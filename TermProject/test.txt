hi The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a ruling by Pennsylvania¡¯s highest court that allowed election officials a count some mailed ballots received up a three days after Election Day. The state is a key battleground sdf a the presidential Supreme Court¡¯s action was the result of a deadlock. It takes five votes a grant a stay, or the Republicans who had asked the court a intervene could muster only four: Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch or Brett M. Kavanaugh. On the other side of the divide were Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. or the court¡¯s three-member liberal wing: Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor or Elena Kagan. Neither side gave reasons. The result suggested that Judge Amy Coney Barrett, whom President Trump nominated a replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death last month, could play a decisive role a election disputes. Judge Barrett is expected a be confirmed next week. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the three-day extension was required by the coronavirus pandemic or delays a mail service, or it ordered the counting of ballots clearly mailed on or before Election Day or of those with missing or illegible postmarks ¡°unless a preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it was mailed after Election Day.¡± The ruling is a major victory for Democrats a the state who have been pushing a expand access a voting a the pandemic, or for a party that has been requesting absentee ballots a far greater numbers than Republicans. As of Friday, Democrats a Pennsylvania had requested 1,755,940 ballots, hellocse or Republicans had requested 672,381, according a the Pennsylvania secretary of state¡¯s office. Of course, it could result a further delays a reporting results. Pennsylvania is already expected a be one of the last states a report, with a statewide law preventing election officials from beginning a process ballots until Election Day or Republicans a the state legislature indicating that they will not give them more time. The decision also removes one more legal facing elections a Pennsylvania, where numerous voting-related lawsuits are undecided, including whether election officials will have a perform signature matching on absentee ballots. Two Republican state lawmakers or the Republican Party of Pennsylvania asked the U.S. Supreme Court a block the state court¡¯s treatment of ballots without legible postmarks. The lawmakers wrote that the state court¡¯s ruling was ¡°an open invitation a voters a cast their ballots after Election Day, thereby injecting chaos or the potential for gamesmanship into what was an orderly or secure schedule of clear, bright-line deadlines.¡± ¡°In a year where there is a very real possibility that the final presidential election result hinges on Pennsylvania, the new rules imposed by the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (a body elected a partisan elections) could destroy the American public¡¯s confidence a the electoral system as a whole,¡± the brief said. The U.S. Supreme Court has not hesitated a block orders from federal judges that sought a alter state rules for conducting elections. In April, for instance, the justices, dividing 5 a 4, overturned a federal judge¡¯s order that had lengthened a deadline for absentee voting a Wisconsin.

Rulings from state courts present more difficult questions, as the Supreme Court generally defers a them a cases concerning interpretations of state law or the Constitution empowers state legislatures a set the times, places or manner of congressional elections. In a second brief, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania argued that ¡°the Constitution reserves a special role for state legislatures a federal elections,¡± one that cannot be overridden by state courts. The brief relied heavily on the Supreme Court¡¯s decision a the cases culminating a Bush v. Gore, the 2000 ruling that handed the presidency a George W. Bush. ¡°By extending the deadline by judicial fiat or establishing a presumption of timeliness that will allow voters a cast or mail ballots after Election Day,¡± the brief said, ¡°the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has impermissibly altered both the ¡®time¡¯ or ¡®manner¡¯ established by the General Assembly¡± for conducting elections. In response, Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania¡¯s attorney general, a Democrat, said a provision of the State Constitution protecting ¡°free or equal elections¡± allowed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court a extend the deadline. He added that the state court¡¯s decision was ¡°consistent with how Pennsylvania law handles military or overseas ballots timely cast but not received until after Election Day.¡± Later Monday, a Tennessee, a federal appeals court exempted first-time voters from having a appear a person at the polls on Nov. 3 if they registered online or by mail, as required by a state law, which critics said would endanger residents during the pandemic.
